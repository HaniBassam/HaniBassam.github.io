            Hi, I’m Hani, a passionate front-end developer and
            multimediedesigner with a flair for creating engaging and
            user-friendly digital experiences. With a solid foundation in HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and React, I enjoy turning complex problems into
            simple, beautiful solutions. My background in graphic design and
            content creation allows me to bring a creative touch to every
            project I work on. I thrive on learning and pushing my skills to the
            next level, whether it’s through coding, exploring new design
            trends, or collaborating with others to create something meaningful.
            I’m detail-oriented, adaptable, and driven by the desire to make a
            positive impact through technology and design. When I’m not coding,
            you’ll often find me brainstorming new ideas or finding inspiration
            to fuel my creativity.
          </p>

            <h1 className="about-me-random---heading">Random Facts</h1>
            <span className="random"></span> I drink way too many energy
            drinks—they’re basically my fuel for creativity. I’m into all kinds
            of design, from sleek UI layouts to bold, out-of-the-box ideas.
            Watching TV is my ultimate chill zone; nothing beats a good series
            marathon to unwind . I absolutely love cooking (and eating, of
            course 🍔), especially when it involves experimenting with spicy
            flavors 🌶️. <br /> I’m a bit of a neat freak 🧹 because a clean
            space equals a clear mind . My goal is to live life with zero
            regrets. I’m slightly addicted to the social media X and always
            enjoy diving into a good meme thread 😂. <br />
            Yoda might be my mentor, caffeine is definitely my co-pilot. Even my
            MacBook 💻 feels like a creative sidekick, always ready to bring
            ideas to life 💡. And secretly, I think I could nail stand-up comedy
            🎤, though my jokes might say otherwise !”**
